# Triangle-Differentiator

The problem that I am faced with is being able to make a program that can differentiate triangles based on the sides that are given. An equilateral triangle has three sides which are equal, an isosceles only has two sides that are equal, and a scalene has no sides that are equal. My goal is to contruct a program that can take in three inputs as the sides and being able to differentiate which triangle it is. 

To get to the final solution, I first had to take inputs from the user to have the sizes of the three sides of the triangle. Next, I constructed if/else statements that would each have a conditional that would be able to differentiate which triangle it is based on the sides that were input. Within the conditionals, I would use logical operators and the compare operator to compare sides and to only run the code within the if/else statements if the requirements were met. If the condition was met on one of the if/else statements, then a statement would be printed telling the user what kind of triangle is made from the sides that were input. If the user didn't input a number, then a separate statement would be made telling the user that an incorrect input was made..
